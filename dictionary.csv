exception,"('In computer programming, an exception is a special condition encountered during program execution that is unexpected or anomalous. For example, if the program tries to open a file from disk, but the file does not exist or there is a disk read error, this condition is an exception. Exceptions must be anticipated by the programmer and properly handled in the program code, branching program execution as appropriate to avoid a fatal error. This aspect of computer programming is known as exception handling.', 'computerhope.com')"
module,"('A module is a separate unit of software or hardware. Typical characteristics of modular components include portability, which allows them to be used in a variety of systems, and interoperability, which allows them to function with the components of other systems.

However, there are other earlier accounts of a bug being used to describe a problem with electrical circuits and hardware.', 'computerhope.com')"

tuple,"('In programming languages, such as Lisp, Python, Linda, and others, a tuple (pronounced TUH-pul) is an ordered set of values. The separator for each value is often a comma (depending on the rules of the particular language). Common uses for the tuple as a data type are (1) for passing a string of parameters from one program to another, and (2) representing a set of value attributes in a relational database. In some languages, tuples can be nested within other tuples within parentheses or brackets or other delimiters. Tuples can contain a mixture of other data types.', 'techtarget.com')"
